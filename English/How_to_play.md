When a scanline passes the center of a note, play it!

TECHMANIA supports 3 different control schemes (Touch/Keys/KM), and 3 different numbers of playable lanes (2/3/4). When selecting a pattern, the icons to the left of its name tell you how many lanes are there, and which control scheme to use.

The Touch control scheme requires a touchscreen. It is recommended that you go to system settings and turn off visual feedback for touches, as they may cause the game to lag. On Windows 10, this option can be found in Settings - Ease of Access - Mouse pointer - Change touch feedback.

# ![Keys icon](https://github.com/techmania-team/techmania-docs/assets/30272345/fbb0b4de-8562-44d5-80fd-6b637d84a534) Keys

The Keys control scheme uses some or all of these 4 rows of keys on your keyboard. Each row corresponds to a lane on the screen. To play a note in a certain lane, press any key in the corresponding row.

![Tutorial screenshot showing the correspondence between rows and lanes](https://github.com/techmania-team/techmania-docs/assets/30272345/d3f7fae9-a0ca-45a2-a2a1-98ec641f39e0)

Currently only the QWERTY keyboard layout is supported.

* For 4-lane patterns, use all 4 rows of keys.
* For 3-lane patterns, use all 3 letter rows.
* For 2-lane patterns, use the bottom 2 letter rows.

KM stands for Keyboard and Mouse. In KM, you use the mouse for some types of notes (basic, chain, drag), and the keyboard for the other types (hold, repeat). Different from the Keys control scheme, here you can press any key in any row to play the keyboard notes, wherever they are.

# About Fever

Regardless of control scheme, you can activate Fever in any of the following ways:

* Touching the Fever button
* Pressing Space/Backspace/Numpad 0/Numpad Enter
* Clicking the Fever button

While active, Fever will improve the judgement of notes played, and recover HP faster.

# About setlists

Setlists are a more challenging way to play TECHMANIA, where you play 4 patterns in a row. Browse and play setlists from the "Setlists" button in the main menu.

A setlist is a named collection of patterns. After selecting a setlist, you need to choose 3 patterns from it, and play through them in one setting, on one HP bar. After finishing all 3 stages, TECHMANIA will choose a 4th pattern for you, and you need to complete it as well to finish the whole setlist.

To further increase the challenge, you can only use 25% of your HP bar for each stage. This means, if you finish the 1st stage with more than 0% but less than 75% of your total HP, it's still counted as a failure. Likewise, you must finish the 2nd stage with more than 50% HP, and the 3rd stage with more than 25% HP.
