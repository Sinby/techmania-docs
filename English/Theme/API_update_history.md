# API version 2

TECHMANIA version: 2.1
Unity version: ???

* Deprecated `Paths.EscapeBackslash`, which now does nothing. Added `Paths.ForceEscapeBackslash` in case escaping is still necessary. `EscapeBackslash` was added in an age when visual elements parsed escape sequences by default; that is no longer the case.
